                  <strong>Autoclave</strong> was an American indie rock band, based in Washington, D.C. They were on 
                  local label Dischord Records. Formed in the summer of 1990, the group consisted of 
                  vocalist and bassist Christina Billotte, lead guitarist Mary Timony, guitarist Nikki 
                  Chapman, and drummer Melissa Berkoff.
        
                  <p>The group broke up in May 1991, with Timony forming Helium and Billotte forming Slant 6.
                      Timony would later release solo albums on Lookout! and Matador, and release music as a 
                      member of Wild Flag and Ex Hex.
